# About

A viewer for 3D visualization of NYU-collected data on egress behavior from NYC COVID-19 exposed health facilities.

# Development

## Setting up the environment

 * Run `npm install` in the repo directory
 * Create a directory named `data` in the repo directory

## Adding data

Data is tracked outside of GitHub due to size. Data loaded into the application include:

### Point cloud data

This application can load and render a point cloud tile converted from the LAS file format to the Potree format using [PotreeConverter](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter). The location of the point cloud tile must be specified using the `URL_CLOUD` field in [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js).

For example, the initial version of this application used point cloud tile 22242 from [NYC Open Data and NYS GIS](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Topobathymetric-LiDAR-Data-2017-/7sc8-jtbz). The point cloud tile LAS file was converted using PotreeConverter which produced a directory named `22242.las_converted` contained converted point cloud data. This entire directory was then placed into the `data` directory and referenced by the application in the `URL_CLOUD` field in [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js). Change the value of `URL_CLOUD` (or `LAS_TILE_CODE`) to direct the application to load a different converted point cloud tile directory.

Additionally, the `LAT_MIN`, `LAT_MAX`, `LON_MIN` and `LON_MAX` values in [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js) should be set to the latitude and longitude coordinates of the point cloud tile bounds (EPSG:4326 / WSG 84) in order to project other latitude/longitude coordinate data into the visualization space.

### Behavioral data

#### Behavioral event location data

This application can load and render 2D point data specified using latitude/longitude coordinates (EPSG:4326 / WSG 84). Data must be specified in the GeoJSON format and may be points or polygons. The application will convert polygons to points using their bounding box centers. The location of this GeoJSON file must be specified using the `GEO_JSON_DATA_URL` field in [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js).

For example, the initial version of this application used polygons generated from a subset of the [DETER dataset](https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu-2451-60075). The polygon centers represented locations of behavioral events. The polygons were represented as a GeoJSON file containing of features with two required attributes: `Name` and `geometry`. This GeoJSON file was placed in the `data` directory and its location was used as the value of the `GEO_JSON_DATA_URL` field in [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js).

#### Behavioral event attribute data

This application can segment 2D point data by their associated attributes. Attribute data must be specified in the CSV format and have a common attribute field with location point data for identifying unique events (e.g. "ID" or "Name"). The location of this CSV file must be specified in the `CSV_DATA_URL` field in  [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js).

For example, the initial version of this application used the `all_records_dta_09142020.csv` file from the [DETER dataset](https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu-2451-60075) to join attributes of events (e.g. gender, time-of-day, PPE-presence) to the locations of those events. This CSV file was placed in the `data` directory and its location was used as the value of the `CSV_DATA_URL` field in [`config.js`](https://github.com/cpcarey/nyu-stc19-egress-web-viewer/blob/main/src/config.js).
